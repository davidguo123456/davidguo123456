## Hi, I'm David! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student studying Engineering Science (Major in Machine Intelligence) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

My interests are mainly in machine learning and software systems. 
Here is a [project](https://github.com/davidguo123456/vae-tmdn-music) I contributed to that used variational autoencoders and transformers to generate piano music!
